Currently AI is advancing in a great pace and deep learning is one of the contributor to that It is good to understand the basics of deep learning as they are changing the world we live This is the first article in deep learning series and will explain different deep learning models in coming articles in the series Some of the images are taken from Udacity deep learning course If you would like to learn deep learning in details I encourage you to enrol to the Udacity’s courseDeep learning is a sub-field of machine learning dealing with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks In other words It mirrors the functioning of our brains Deep learning algorithms are similar to how nervous system structured where each neuron connected each other and passing informationDeep learning models work in layers and a typical model atleast have three layers Each layer accepts the information from previous and pass it on to the next oneDeep learning models tend to perform well with amount ofdata wheras old machine learning models stops improving after a saturation point
Activation functions are functions that decide given the inputs into the node what should be the node’s output? Because it’s the activation function that decides the actual output we often refer to the outputs of a layer as its “activations”
One of the simplest activation functions is the Heaviside step function This function returns a 0 if the linear combination is less than 0 It returns a 1 if the linear combination is positive or equal to zero
