By the late 1990s many people felt that continuing to index
the whole Web would rapidly become impossible due to the Web’s exponential growth in size But major scientific innovations superb engineering
the rapidly declining price of computer hardware and the rise of a commercial underpinning for web search have all conspired to power today’s major
search engines which are able to provide high-quality results within subsecond response times for hundreds of millions of searches a day over billions
of web pages
Nevertheless in recent years a principal driver of innovation has been the
World Wide Web unleashing publication at the scale of tens of millions of
content creators This explosion of published information would be moot
if the information could not be found annotated and analyzed so that each
user can quickly find information that is both relevant and comprehensive
for their needs
Many people gave us detailed feedback on individual chapters either at
our request or through their own initiative For this we’re particularly grateful to: James Allan Omar Alonso Ismail Sengor Altingovde Vo Ngoc Anh

The indexes and queries considered in Chapters 1–5
only deal with Boolean retrieval in which a document either matches a query
or does not A desire to measure the extent to which a document matches a
query or the score of a document for a query motivates the development of
term weighting and the computation of scores in Chapters 6 and 7 leading
to the idea of a list of documents that are rank-ordered for a query Chapter 8
focuses on the evaluation of an information retrieval system based on the
relevance of the documents it retrieves allowing us to compare the relative
performances of different systems on benchmark document collections and
queries
