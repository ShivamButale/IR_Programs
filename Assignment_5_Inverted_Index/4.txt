Book organization and course development
This book is the result of a series of courses we have taught at Stanford University and at the University of Stuttgart in a range of durations including
a single quarter one semester and two quarters These courses were aimed
at early-stage graduate students in computer science but we have also had
enrollment from upper-class computer science undergraduates as well as
students from law medical informatics statistics linguistics and various engineering disciplines The key design principle for this book therefore was
to cover what we believe to be important in a one-term graduate course on
information retrieval An additional principle is to build each chapter around
material that we believe can be covered in a single lecture of 75 to 90 minutes
The first eight chapters of the book are devoted to the basics of information retrieval and in particular the heart of search engines; we consider this
material to be core to any course on information retrieval Chapter 1 introduces inverted indexes and shows how simple Boolean queries can be
processed using such indexes Chapter 2 builds on this introduction by detailing the manner in which documents are preprocessed before indexing
and by discussing how inverted indexes are augmented in various ways for
functionality and speed Chapter 3 discusses search structures for dictionaries and how to process queries that have spelling errors and other imprecise
matches to the vocabulary in the document collection being searched Chapter 4 describes a number of algorithms for constructing the inverted index
from a text collection with particular attention to highly scalable and distributed algorithms that can be applied to very large collections Chapter 5
covers techniques for compressing dictionaries and inverted indexes These
techniques are critical for achieving subsecond response times to user queries
in large search engines
