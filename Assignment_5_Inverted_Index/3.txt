As recently as the 1990s studies showed that most people preferred getting
information from other people rather than from information retrieval systems Of course in that time period most people also used human travel
agents to book their travel However during the last decade relentless optimization of information retrieval effectiveness has driven web search engines
to new quality levels where most people are satisfied most of the time and
web search has become a standard and often preferred source of information
finding For example the 2004 Pew Internet Survey (Fallows 2004) found
that “92% of Internet users say the Internet is a good place to go for getting
everyday information” To the surprise of many the field of information retrieval has moved from being a primarily academic discipline to being the
basis underlying most people’s preferred means of information access This
book presents the scientific underpinnings of this field at a level accessible
to graduate students as well as advanced undergraduates
Information retrieval did not begin with the Web In response to various
challenges of providing information access the field of information retrieval
evolved to give principled approaches to searching various forms of content The field began with scientific publications and library records but
soon spread to other forms of content particularly those of information professionals such as journalists lawyers and doctors Much of the scientific
research on information retrieval has occurred in these contexts and much of
the continued practice of information retrieval deals with providing access to
unstructured information in various corporate and governmental domains
and this work forms much of the foundation of our book
